# A study into Food Insecurity and Resource Allocation

## üìñ Overview
"Imagine a world where millions wake up unsure if they'll have enough to eat‚Äîthis is the stark reality of food insecurity. Food insecurity, the lack of reliable access to sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food, is a growing global challenge, especially as the population nears the next billion. This project delves into the key factors driving food insecurity, analyzing regional trends and patterns to uncover critical insights. At its core is the Food Insecurity Severity Index (FISI)‚Äîa composite metric designed to quantify and track global food insecurity severity, guiding impactful solutions.

## üéØ Objective
- Identify key indicators influencing food insecurity based on four pillars: **Availability, Access, Utilization, and Stability.**

- Develop the Food Insecurity Severity Index (FISI) as a composite metric.
- Analyze trends, patterns, and anomalies in food security indicators.
- Provide region-specific recommendations for mitigating food insecurity.
- Provide actionable insights to aid policy decisions and strengthen governmental and external programs.

## üóÇÔ∏è DATA
**Source**: World Bank Development Indicators (1963-2023) [World Bank Development Indicators ](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/World-Development-Indicators)

**Scope**: 1513 indicators across 217 countries; data refined to 44 indicators (2000-2020).

**Themes**: Agriculture, Economy, Health, Environment, Demographics, Education, Water & santitation, and Governance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Cleaned data by imputing missing values based on hierarchical strategies/predefined rules
- Addressed outliers and consolidated data for analysis (2000‚Äì2020).

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- Explored regional and income-group trends in cereal yields, undernourishment, and poverty.
- Analyzed the effects of extreme weather events and governance on food security over two decades (2000-2020).
  
**Feature Engineering - FISI Development:** Calculated FISI scores by aggregating weighted normalized values of indicators (0 = best security; 1 = worst insecurity).

- Risk Categories:<br>
        - Low Risk (FISI ‚â§ 0.5),<br>
        - Medium Risk (0.5< FISI ‚â§ 0.63),<br>
        - High Risk (FISI > 0.63)
  
**Clustering Analysis:** Applied K-means clustering to uncover natural groupings in countries based on FISI scores and further visualized with PCA.

**Trend Analysis:** Identified expected and unexpected trends across regions.

## üåü Key Insights
- South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa show the highest FISI scores, indicating severe food insecurity.

- Access and utilization of resources are critical; availability alone is insufficient.
- Political stability and economic strength significantly impact food insecurity levels.
- Improved food security in regions like Somalia due to effective interventions.
- Highlighted the negative impacts of political instability, climate change, and high refugee populations on food security.

## üöÄ Results
- FISI: A scalable metric categorizing countries into low, medium, and high-risk zones.
- Recommendation: Enhance agricultural productivity.
        - Focus on improving resource access and governance.
        - Mitigate risks from extreme weather and political instability.
- Visualized food insecurity trends and identified actionable insights for targeted interventions.
  
## üí°Community Contribution

- Afghanistan: To focus on creating employment opportunities to enhance GDP and improve food accessibility.
- Greece: Limit refugee intake due to resource constraints like GDP and arable land.
- South Sudan: Prioritize political stability to boost employment and food access.
- Somalia: Continue efforts in food production to transition from high to medium/low food insecurity risk.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python for data analysis and visualization.
