    <td>Imagine a world where millions wake up unsure if they'll have enough to eatâ€”this is the stark reality of food insecurity. Food insecurity, the lack of reliable access to sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food, is a growing global challenge, especially as the population nears the next billion. This project delves into the key factors driving food insecurity, analyzing regional trends and patterns to uncover critical insights.</td>
